# advertima_task
Python notebook for the fashion mnist analysis and model building.

# Python notebook

I have chosen to approach the handling of this task with a jupyter notebook, because it allows for both writing the code and documenting 
it at the same time. This allows for an intuitive stroll through the code, along with graphs and images to make the code more understandable.

# The task

To solve the task of learning the fashion mnist, I have chosen to make a CNN with 3 convolutional layers and two fully connected layers at the output.
When adding dropout and data augmentation, I could achieve accuracy of 93%. 
Apart from these, other optimizations are explored through the notebook as well.
A more detailed conclusion with the references can be found at the end of the notebook.

# Enjoy!
